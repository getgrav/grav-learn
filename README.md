# Grav Documentation

This is the repository for all the functionality of https://learn.getgrav.org. It is what we call a **skeleton** in that it's drop-in replacement for the `user/` folder in Grav. 

To install your own copy of the learn site, simply follow these steps:

1. [Download Grav](https://getgrav.org/downloads) from the https://getgrav.org site
2. Extract the ZIP archive into a directory in your webroot (e.g. `~/www/grav-learn/`)
3. [Download](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-learn/archive/develop.zip) and extract, or [Clone](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-learn.git), the **grav-learn** repository as `~/www/grav-learn/user/`
4. Run `bin/grav install` from the root (e.g. `~/www/grav-learn/`)

At this point the required plugins and vendor libraries should be installed, and your learn site should be fully functional.
