All Grav configuration files are written in [YAML syntax](../../advanced/yaml) with a `.yaml` file extension.  YAML is very intuitive which makes it very easy to both read and write, however, you can check out the [YAML page in the Advanced chapter](../../advanced/yaml) to get a complete understanding of the syntax available.

## System Configuration

Grav focuses on making things as easy as possible for the user, and the same goes for configuration.  Grav comes with some sensible default options, and these are contained in a file that resides in the `system/config/system.yaml` file.

However, **you should never change this file**, instead any configuration changes you need to make should be stored in a file called `user/config/system.yaml`.  Any setting in this file with the same structure and naming will override the setting provided in the default system configuration file.

!!!! Generally speaking you should **NEVER** change anything in the `system/` folder.  All things the user does (creating content, installing plugins, editing configuration, etc.) should be done in the `user/` folder.  This way it allows simpler upgrading and also keeps your changes all in one location for backing up, synchronizing, etc.

Here are the variables found in the default `system/config/system.yaml` file:

### Basic Options

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
absolute_urls: false
timezone: ''
default_locale:
param_sep: ':'
wrapped_site: false
reverse_proxy_setup: false
force_ssl: false
force_lowercase_urls: true
custom_base_url: ''
username_regex: '^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$'
pwd_regex: '(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}'
intl_enabled: true
http_x_forwarded:
  protocol: true
  host: false
  port: true
  ip: true
[/prism]

These configuration options do not appear within their own child sections. They're general options that affect the way the site operates, its timezone, and base URL.

[div class="table-keycol"]

| **absolute_urls:** | Absolute or relative URLs for `base_url` |
| **timezone:** | Valid values can be found [here](https://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php) |
| **default_locale:** | Default locale (defaults to system) |

| **yaml_compat:** | Enables YAML backwards compatibility |
| **twig_compat:** | Enables deprecated Twig autoescape setting |
[/div]

!! You do not need to copy the **entire** configuration file to override it, you can override as little or as much as you like.  Just ensure you have the **exact same naming structure** for the particular setting you want to override.

## Site Configuration

As well as the `system.yaml` file, Grav also provides a default `site.yaml` configuration file that is used to set some front-end specific configuration such as author name, author email, as well as some key taxonomy settings.  You can override these in the same way as you would the system.yaml by providing your own configuration file in `user/config/site.yaml`. You can also use this file to put in arbitrary configuration options that you may want to reference from your content or templates.

The default `system/config/site.yaml` file that ships with Grav looks something like this:

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
title: Grav                                 # Name of the site
default_lang: en                            # Default language for site (potentially used by theme)

author:

Let's break down the elements of this sample file:

[div class="table-keycol"]
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **title:** | The title is a simple string variable that can be referenced whenever you want to display the name of this site |
| **author:** | |
| ... **name:** | The name of the author of the site, that can be referenced whenever you need it |
| ... **email:** | A default email for use in your site |
| **taxonomies:** | An arbitrary list of high-level types that you can use to organize your content.  You can assign content to specific taxonomy types, for example, categories or tags. Feel free to edit, or add your own |
| **metadata:** | Set default metadata for all your pages, see the [content page headers](../../content/headers) section for more details |
| **summary:** | |
| ... **size:** | A variable to override the default number of characters that can be used to set the summary size when displaying a portion of content |
| **routes:** | This is a basic map that can provide simple URL alias capabilities in Grav.  If you browse to `/something/else` you will actually be sent to `/blog/sample-3`. Feel free to edit, or add your own as needed. **Regex Replacements** (`(.*) - $1`) are now supported at the end of route aliases.  You should put these at the bottom of the list for optimal performance |
| **(custom options)** | You can create any option you like in this file and a good example is the `blog: route: '/blog'` option that is accessible in your Twig templates with `site.blog.route` |
[/div]

!! For most people, the most important element of this file is the `Taxonomy` list.  The taxonomies in this list **must** be defined here if you wish to use them in your content.

## Security

For increased security there is `system/config/security.yaml` file that sets some sensible defaults and is used by the Admin plugin when **Saving** content, as well in the new **Reports** section of **Tools**.

The default configuration looks like this:

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
xss_whitelist: [admin.super]
xss_enabled:
    on_events: true
    invalid_protocols: true
    moz_binding: true
    html_inline_styles: true
    dangerous_tags: true
xss_invalid_protocols:
    - javascript
    - livescript
    - vbscript
    - mocha
    - feed
    - data
xss_dangerous_tags:
    - applet
    - meta
    - xml
    - blink
    - link
    - style
    - script
    - embed
    - object
    - iframe
    - frame
    - frameset
    - ilayer
    - layer
    - bgsound
    - title
    - base
uploads_dangerous_extensions:
    - php
    - html
    - htm
    - js
    - exe
sanitize_svg: true
[/prism]

If you wish to make any changes to these settings, you should copy this file to `user/config/security.yaml` and make edits there.

## Other Configuration Settings and Files

User configuration is completely optional. You can override as little or as much of the default settings as you need. This applies to both the system, site, and any plugin configurations in your site.

You are also not limited to the `user/config/system.yaml` or the `user/config/site.yaml` files as described above. You can create any arbitrary `.yaml` configuration file in the `user/config` folder you wish and it will get picked up by Grav automatically.

As an example if the new configuration file is named `user/config/data.yaml` and a yaml variable in this file is called count:

```
count: 39
```

The variable would be accessed in your Twig template by using the following syntax:

```
{{ config.data.count }}
```

It would also be accessible via PHP from any plugin with the code:

```
$count_var = Grav::instance()['config']->get('data.count');
```

! You can also provide a custom blueprint to enable your custom file to be editable in the admin plugin. Check out the relevant [recipe in the Admin Cookbook section](/cookbook/admin-recipes#add-a-custom-yaml-file).

### Config Variable Namespacing

Paths to the configuration files will be used as a **namespace** for your configuration options.

Alternatively, you can put all the options into one file and use YAML structures to specify the hierarchy for your configuration options. This namespacing is built from a combination of the **path + filename + option name**.

For example: An option such as `author: Frank Smith` in file `plugins/myplugin.yaml` could be accessible via: `plugins.myplugin.author`. However, you could also have a `plugins.yaml` file and in that file have an option name called `myplugin: author: Frank Smith` and it would still be reachable by the same `plugins.myplugin.author` namespace.

Some example configuration files could be structured:

[div class="table-keycol"]
| File | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **user/config/system.yaml**           | Global system configuration file                  |
| **user/config/site.yaml**             | A site-specific configuration file                |
| **user/config/plugins/myplugin.yaml** | Individual configuration file for myplugin plugin |
| **user/config/themes/mytheme.yaml**   | Individual configuration file for mytheme theme   |
[/div]

!! Having a namespaced configuration file will override or mask all options having the same path in the default configuration files

### Plugins Configuration

Most **plugins** will come with their own YAML configuration file. We recommend copying this file to the `user/config/plugins/` directory rather than editing configuration options directly to the file located in the plugin's directory. Doing this will ensure that an update to the plugin will not overwrite your settings, and keep all of your configurable options in one, convenient place.

If you have a plugin called `user/plugins/myplugin` that has a configuration file called `user/plugins/myplugin/myplugin.yaml` then you would copy this file to `user/config/plugins/myplugin.yaml` and edit the file there.

The YAML file that exists within the plugin's primary directory will act as a fallback. Any settings listed there and not in the User folder's copy will be picked up and used by Grav.

### Themes Configuration

The same rules for **themes** apply as they did for plugins.  So if you have a theme called `user/themes/mytheme` that has a configuration file called `user/themes/mytheme/mytheme.yaml` then you would copy this file to `user/config/themes/mytheme.yaml` and edit the file there.
