Although we have done our best to cover as much as possible here in the documentation, it is inevitable that there will be questions about Grav that we have not answered.  We want to be as accessible as possible, so we have several methods to get help directly from the developers:

## Forum

We have a new [real-time forum solution](https://discourse.getgrav.org/) utilizing the **Discourse** platform to provide a simple way to get your Grav questions answered quickly.

## Twitter

We **highly recommend** you [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/getgrav) as it provides a real-time way for us to reach out to our followers and let them know about news and events related to Grav development.

## Grav Blog

You can join in a discussion on any of the topics we post about on the [Grav Development Blog](https://getgrav.org/blog) via the comments.  We will post all the major news and information to our blog, as well as useful posts about development in general. We also have plans to share tutorials and hints on how to get the most out of Grav.

## GitHub Issues

If you find a bug, have a general question or even want to contribute to the Grav project as a whole, you can use the [Grav GitHub Issues tracker](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/issues).  We are very diligent about responding to issues posted here, and it can provide a useful way to start a conversation with us.  If you have a specific problem with one of our plugins, themes or skeletons, you can also submit an issue on that repository.

## Chat on Discord

You can **chat with us live** on [Discord](https://chat.getgrav.org). We recently [moved from Slack to Discord](https://getgrav.org/blog/chat-moving-to-discord) for our community chat platform, and now hang out there.  So [join us there](https://chat.getgrav.org) and get involved with the growing Grav community!
