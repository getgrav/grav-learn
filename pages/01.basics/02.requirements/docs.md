Grav is intentionally designed with few requirements. You can easily run Grav on your local computer, as well as 99% of all Web hosting providers. If you have a pen handy, jot down the following Grav system requirements:

1. Web Server (Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, Lightly, IIS, etc.)
[version=15]
2. PHP 5.6.3 or higher
[/version]
[version=16]
2. PHP 7.1.3 or higher
[/version]
3. hmm... that's it really, (but please look at PHP requirements for a smooth experience)!

Grav is built with plain text files for your content. There is no database needed.

!! A PHP user cache such as APCu, Memcached, or Redis is highly recommended for optimal performance. Not to worry though, these are usually already part of your hosting package!

## Web Servers

Grav is so simple and versatile that you don't even need a web server to run it. You can run it directly off the built-in PHP webserver, as long as you're running [version=15]**PHP 5.6.3**[/version][version=16]**PHP 7.1.3**[/version] or later.

Testing with the built-in webservers is a useful way to check a Grav install and perform some brief development, but it is **not** recommended for a live site or even for advanced development tasks. We've outlined how in our [Installation guide](../installation#running-grav-with-the-built-in-php-webserver-using-routerphp).

Even though technically you do not need a standalone web server, it is better to run one, even for local development. There are many great options available:

### Mac

* MacOS 10.14 Mojave already ships with the Apache Web server and PHP 7.1, so job done!
* [MAMP/MAMP Pro](http://mamp.info) comes with Apache, MySQL and of course PHP. It is a great way to get more control over which version of PHP you are running, setting up virtual hosts, plus other useful features such as automatically handling dynamic DNS.
* [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/downloads) is a software stack from Softaculous enabling Apache, PHP, Perl, Python,.. This includes everything you need (and more) for GRAV development.
* [Brew Apache/PHP](https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-mojave-apache-multiple-php-versions) is an alternative approach that allows a fully configurable installation with various PHP versions.

### Windows

* [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) portable, isolated, fast & powerful universal development environment for PHP, Node.js, and more. It is fast, lightweight, easy-to-use and easy-to-extend.
* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) provides Apache, PHP, and MySQL in one simple package.
* [EasyPHP](http://www.easyphp.org/) provides a personal Web hosting package as well as a more powerful developer version.
* [MAMP for Windows](http://mamp.info) is a long-time Mac favorite, but now available for Windows.
* [IIS with PHP](http://php.iis.net/) is a fast way to run PHP on Windows.
* [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/downloads) is a software stack from Softaculous enabling Apache, PHP, Perl, Python,.. This includes everything you need (and more) for GRAV development.
* [Linux Subsystem](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/setup-a-php-development-environment-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-9193ff28ae83) is a great way to Run a linux-like environment on Windows

### Linux

* Many distributions of Linux already come with Apache and PHP built-in. If they're not, the distribution usually provides a package manager through which you can install them without much hassle. More advanced configurations should be investigated with the help of a good search engine.

### Apache Requirements

Even though most distributions of Apache come with everything needed, for the sake of completeness, here is a list of required Apache modules:

* `mod_rewrite`
* `mod_ssl` (if you wish to run Grav under SSL)

You should also ensure you have `AllowOverride All` set in the `<Directory>` and/or `<VirtualHost>` blocks so that the `.htaccess` file processes correctly, and rewrite rules take effect.

### IIS Requirements

Although IIS is considered a web server ready to run 'out-of-the-box', some changes need to be made.

To get **Grav** running on an IIS server, you need to install **URL Rewrite**. This can be accomplished using **Microsoft Web Platform Installer** from within IIS. You can also install URL Rewrite by going to [iis.net](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite).

### PHP Requirements

Most hosting providers and even local LAMP setups have PHP pre-configured with everything you need for Grav to run 'out-of-the-box'. However, some Windows setups, and even Linux distributions local or on VPS (I'm looking at you Debian!) - ship with a very minimal PHP compile. Therefore, you may need to install or enable these PHP modules:

* `curl` (client for URL handling used by GPM)
* `ctype` (used by symfony/yaml/Inline)
* `dom` (used by grav/admin newsfeed)
* `gd` (a graphics library used to manipulate images)
* `json` (used by Symfony/Composer/GPM)
* `mbstring` (multibyte string support)
* `openssl` (secure sockets library used by GPM)
* `session` (used by toolbox)
* `simplexml` (used by grav/admin newsfeed)
* `xml` (XML support)
* `zip` extension support (used by GPM)

For enabling `openssl` and (un)zip support you will need to find in the `php.ini` file of your Linux distribution for lines like:

[prism classes="language-bash line-numbers"]
;extension=openssl.so
;extension=zip.so
[/prism]

and remove the leading semicolon.

##### Optional Modules

* `apcu` for increased cache performance
* `opcache` for increased PHP performance
* `yaml` PECL Yaml provides native yaml processing and can dramatically increase performance
* `xdebug` useful for debugging in a development environment

### Permissions

For Grav to function correctly, your web server needs to have the appropriate **file permissions** to write logs, caches, etc. When using either the [CLI](/advanced/grav-cli) (Command Line Interface) or [GPM](/advanced/grav-gpm) (Grav Package Manager), the user running PHP from the command line also needs to have the appropriate permissions to modify files.

By default, Grav will install with `644` and `755` permissions for files and folders, respectively. Most hosting providers have configurations that ensure that a web server running PHP will allow you to create and modify files within your user account. This means that Grav runs **out-of-the-box** on the vast majority of hosting providers.

However, if you are running on a dedicated server or even your local environment, you may need to adjust permissions to ensure your **user** and your **web server** can modify files as needed. There are a couple of approaches you can take.

1. In a **local development environment**, you can usually configure your web server to run under your user profile. This way the web server will always allow you to create and modify files.

2. Change the **group permissions** on all files and folders so that the web server's group has write access to files and folders while keeping the standard permissions. This requires a few commands to make this work.

First, find out which user Apache runs with by running the following command:

[prism classes="language-bash command-line"]
ps aux | grep -v root | grep apache | cut -d\  -f1 | sort | uniq
[/prism]

Now, find out which group this user belongs to by running this command (note: adjust USERNAME with the apache username you found in the previous command)

[prism classes="language-bash command-line"]
groups USERNAME
[/prism]

(note: adjust `GROUP` to be the group your apache runs under, found in the previous command. [`www-data`, `apache`, `nobody`, etc.]):

[prism classes="language-bash line-numbers"]
chgrp -R GROUP .
find . -type f | xargs chmod 664
find ./bin -type f | xargs chmod 775
find . -type d | xargs chmod 775
find . -type d | xargs chmod +s
umask 0002
[/prism]

If you need to invoke superuser permissions, you would run `find … | sudo xargs chmod …` instead.

## Recommended Tools

### Text Editors

Although you can get away with Notepad, Textedit, Vi, or whatever default text editor comes with your platform, we recommend using a good text editor with syntax highlighting to make things easier. Here are some recommended options:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Similar to Atom, it's built using Electron, Node, as well as HTML/CSS.  It's quite lightweight and has many plugins available, including very good support for PHP and JavaScript.  This is the current recommended editor for developing for Grav.
2. [Atom](http://atom.io) - MacOS/Windows/Linux - A new editor developed by Github. It's free and open source. It is similar to Sublime, but does not have the sheer depth of plugins available yet.
3. [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - MacOS/Windows/Linux - A commercial developer's editor, but well worth the price. Very powerful especially combined with plugins such as [Markdown Extended](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Markdown%20Extended), [Pretty YAML](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Pretty%20YAML), and [PHP-Twig](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/PHP-Twig).
4. [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Windows - A free and very popular developer's editor for Windows.
5. [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html) - MacOS/Windows/Linux - A free, open source text editor geared towards programmers and web developers.

### Markdown Editors

Another option if you primarily work with just creating content, is to use a dedicated **Markdown Editor**. These often are very content-centric and usually provide a **live-preview** of your content rendered as HTML. There are literally hundreds of these, but some good options include:

1. [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) - MacOS - Free, a simple, lightweight open source Markdown editor.
2. [LightPaper](http://lightpaper.42squares.in/) - MacOS - $9.99, clean, powerful. Our markdown editor of choice on the Mac. **Get 25% OFF with Discount Code: GET_GRAV_25**
3. [MarkDrop](http://culturezoo.com/markdrop/) - MacOS - $5, but super clean and Droplr support built-in.
4. [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) - Windows - Free and Pro versions. Even has YAML front-matter support. An excellent solution for Windows users.
5. [Mark Text](https://marktext.github.io/website/) - Free, open source Markdown editor for Windows / Linux / MacOS.

### FTP Clients

Although there are many ways to deploy **Grav**, the simplest is to copy your local site to your hosting provider. The easiest way to accomplish this is with an [FTP Client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol). There are many available, but some recommended ones include:

1. [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) - MacOS - The de facto FTP/SFTP client on MacOS. Easy to use, fast, folder-syncing and pretty much anything else you could ask for.
2. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) - MacOS/Windows/Linux - Probably the best option for Windows and Linux users. Free and very powerful (but very ugly on the Mac!).
3. [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) - MacOS/Windows - A decent free option for both MacOS and Windows users. Not as full-featured as the others.
4. [ForkLift](http://www.binarynights.com/forklift/) - MacOS - A solid alternative to Transmit, and slightly cheaper to boot.
