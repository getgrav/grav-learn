Collections have grown considerably since the early betas of Grav. We started off with a very limited set of page-based collections, but with the help of our community we have increased these capabilities to make them even more powerful!  So much so that they now have their own section in the documentation.

The most common way to make use of collections is to define a collection in the page.  This means the collection defined is available in the Twig of the page to do with as you wish.  Common examples of this include displaying a list of blog posts, or displaying modular sub-pages to render a complex page design.

## Example Collection Definition

An example collection defined in the page's frontmatter:

```
content:
    items: @self.children
    order:
        by: date
        dir: desc
    limit: 10
    pagination: true
```

This definition creates a collection for the page that consists of the all **child pages** sorted by **date** in **descending** order with **pagination** showing **10 items** per-page.

## Accessing Collections in Twig

When this collection is defined in the header, you can access the collection with:

```
{% for p in page.collection %}
<h2>{{ p.title }}</h2>
{{ p.summary }}
{% endfor %}
```

This simply loops over the pages in the collection displaying the title and summary.

## Collection Headers

To tell Grav that a specific page should be a listing page and contain child-pages, there are a number of variables that can be used:

### Summary of collection options

|                   String                  |                           Result                          |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| '@root'                                   | Get the root children                                     |
| '@root.children'                          | Get the root children (alternative)                       |
| '@root.descendants'                       | Get the root and recurse through ALL children             |
|                                           |                                                           |
| '@self.parent'                            | Get the parent of the current page                        |
| '@self.siblings'                          | A collection of all other pages on this level             |
| '@self.modular'                           | Get only the modular children                             |
| '@self.children'                          | Get the non-modular children                              |
| '@self.descendants'                       | Recurse through all the non-modular children              |
|                                           |                                                           |
| '@page': '/fruit'                         | Get all the children of page `/fruit`                     |
| '@page.children': '/fruit'                | Alternative to above                                      |
| '@page.self': '/fruit'                    | Get a collection with only the page `/fruit`              |
| '@page.page': '/fruit'                    | Alternative to above                                      |
| '@page.descendants': '/fruit'             | Get and recurse through all the children of page `/fruit` |
| '@page.modular': '/fruit'                 | Get a collection of all modular subpages of `/fruit`      |
|                                           |                                                           |
| '@taxonomy.tag': photography              | taxonomy with tag=`photography`                           |
| '@taxonomy': {tag: birds, category: blog} | taxonomy with tag=`birds` && category=`blog`              |


! This document outlines the use of `@page`, `@taxonomy.category` etc, but a more YAML-safe alternative format is `page@`, `taxonomy@.category`.  All the `@` commands can be written in either prefix or postfix format.

We will cover these more in detail. The `content.items` value tells Grav to gather up a collection of items and information passed to this defines how the collection is to be built.

## Root Collections

##### @root - Top level children

This can be used to retrieve the top/root level **published non-modular children** of a site. Particular useful for getting the items that make up the primary navigation for example:

```ruby
content:
    items: '@root'
```

an alias is also valid:

```ruby
content:
    items: '@root.children'
```

##### @root - Top level children + all descendants

This will effectively get every page in your site as it recursively navigates through all the children from the root page down, and builds a collection of **all** the **published non-modular children** of a site.

```ruby
content:
    items: '@root.descendants'
```

## Self Collections

##### @self.children - Children of the current page

This is used to list the **published non-modular children** of the current page:

```ruby
content:
    items: '@self.children'
```

##### @self.descendants - Non-modular children + all descendants of the current page

Similar to `.children`, the `.descendants` collection will retrieve all the **published non-modular children** but continue to recurse through all their children.

```ruby
content:
    items: '@self.descendants'
```

##### @self.modular - Modular children of the current page

The inverse of `.children`, this method retrieves only **published modular children** of the current page (`_features`, `_showcase`, etc.)

```ruby
content:
    items: '@self.modular'
```

##### @self.parent - The parent page of the current page

This is a special case collection because it will always return just the one **parent** of the current page

```ruby
content:
    items: '@self.parent'
```

##### @self.siblings - All the sibling pages

This collection will collect all the **published** Pages at the same level of the current page, excluding the current page.

```ruby
content:
    items: '@self.siblings'
```

## Page Collections

##### @page or @page.children - Collection of children of a specific page

This collection takes a slug route of a page as an argument and will return all the **published non-modular** children of that page

```ruby
content:
    items:
      '@page': '/blog'
```

alternatively:

```ruby
content:
    items:
      '@page.children': '/blog'
```

##### @page.self or @page.page - Collection of just the specific page

This collection takes a slug route of a page as an argument and will return collection containing that page (if it is **published and non-modular**)

```ruby
content:
    items:
      '@page.self': '/blog'
```

##### @page.descendants - Collection of children + all descendants of a specific page

This collection takes a slug route of a page as an argument and will return all the **published non-modular** children and all their descendants of that page

```ruby
content:
    items:
      '@page.descendants': '/blog'
```

##### @page.modular - Collection of modular children of a specific page

This collection takes a slug route of a page as an argument and will return all the **published modular** children of that page

```ruby
content:
    items:
      '@page.modular': '/blog'
```


## Taxonomy Collections

```ruby
content:
   items:
      '@taxonomy.tag': foo
```

Using the `@taxonomy` option, you can utilize Grav's powerful taxonomy functionality.  This is where the `taxonomy` variable in the [Site Configuration](../../basics/grav-configuration#site-configuration) file comes into play. There **must** be a definition for the taxonomy defined in that configuration file for Grav to interpret a page reference to it as valid.

By setting `@taxonomy.tag: foo`, Grav will find all the **published pages** in the `/user/pages` folder that have themselves set `tag: foo` in their taxonomy variable.

```ruby
content:
    items:
       '@taxonomy.tag': [foo, bar]
```

The `content.items` variable can take an array of taxonomies and it will gather up all pages that satisfy these rules. Published pages that have **both** `foo` **and** `bar` tags will be collected.  The [Taxonomy](../taxonomy) chapter will cover this concept in more detail.

!! If you wish to place multiple variables inline, you will need to separate sub-variables from their parents with `{}` brackets. You can then separate individual variables on that level with a comma. For example: `@taxonomy: {category: [blog, featured], tag: [foo, bar]}`. In this example, the `category` and `tag` sub-variables are placed under `@taxonomy` in the hierarchy, each with listed values placed within `[]` brackets. Pages must meet **all** these requirements to be found.

If you have multiple variables in a single parent to set, you can do this using the inline method, but for simplicity, we recommend using the standard method. Here is an example.

```ruby
content:
  items:
    '@taxonomy':
      category: [blog, featured]
      tag: [foo, bar]
```

Each level in the hierarchy adds two whitespaces before the variable. YAML will allow you to use as many spaces as you want here, but two is standard practice. In the above example, both the `category` and `tag` variables are set under `@taxonomy`.

### Complex Collections

With Grav **0.9.41** you can now provide multiple complex collection definitions and the resulting collection will be the sum of all the pages found from each of the collection definitions.

for example:

```ruby
content:
  items:
    - '@self.children'
    - '@taxonomy':
         category: [blog, featured]
```

### Ordering Options

```ruby
content:
    order:
        by: date
        dir: desc
    limit: 5
    pagination: true
```

Ordering of sub-pages follows the same rules as ordering of folders, the available options are:

| Ordering     | Details                                                                                                                                            |
| :----------  | :----------                                                                                                                                        |
| **default**  | The order based on the file system, i.e. `01.home` before `02.advark`                                                                              |
| **title**    | The order is based on the title as defined in each page                                                                                            |
| **basename** | The order is based on the alphabetic folder name after it has been processed by the `basename()` PHP function                                      |
| **date**     | The order based on the date as defined in each page                                                                                                |
| **modified** | The order based on the modified timestamp of the page                                                                                              |
| **folder**   | The order based on the folder name with any numerical prefix, i.e. `01.`, removed                                                                  |
| **header.x** | The order based on any page header field. i.e. `header.taxonomy.year`. Also a default can be added via a pipe. i.e. `header.taxonomy.year|2015`    |
| **manual**   | The order based on the `order_manual` variable                                                                                                     |
| **random**   | The order is randomized                                                                                                                            |

The `content.order.dir` variable controls which direction the ordering should be in. Valid values are either `desc` or `asc`.

```ruby
content:
    order:
        by: default
        custom:
            - _showcase
            - _highlights
            - _callout
            - _features
    limit: 5
    pagination: true
```

In the above configuration, you can see that `content.order.custom` is defining a **custom manual ordering** to ensure the page is constructed with the **showcase** first, **highlights** section second etc. Please note that if a page is not specified in the custom ordering list, then Grav falls back on the `content.order.by` for the unspecified pages.

If a page has a custom slug, you must use that slug in the `content.order.custom` list.

The `content.pagination` is a simple boolean flag to be used by plugins etc to know if **pagination** should be initialized for this collection. `content.limit` is the number of items displayed per-page when pagination is enabled.

### Date Range

New as of **Grav 0.9.13** is the ability to filter by a date range:

```
content:
    items: '@self.children'
    dateRange:
        start: 1/1/2014
        end: 1/1/2015
```

You can use any string date format supported by [strtotime()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtotime.php) such as `-6 weeks` or `last Monday` as well as more traditional dates such as `01/23/2014` or `23 January 2014`. The dateRange will filter out any pages that have a date outside the provided dateRange.  Both **start** and **end** dates are optional, but at least one should be provided.

### Multiple Collections

When you create a collection with `content: items:` in your YAML, you are defining a single collection based on a several conditions.  However, Grav does let you create an arbitrary set of collections per page, you just need to create another one:

```
content:
    items: @self.children
    order:
        by: date
        dir: desc
    limit: 10
    pagination: true

fruit:
    items:
       '@taxonomy.tag': [fruit]
```

This sets up **2 collections** for this page, the first uses the default `content` collection, but the second one defines a taxonomy-based collection called `fruit`.  To access these two collections via Twig you can use the following syntax:

```
{% set default_collection = page.collection %}

{% set fruit_collection = page.collection('fruit') %}
```

## Collection Object

When you define a collection in the page header, you are dynamically creating a [Grav Collection](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/blob/develop/system/src/Grav/Common/Page/Collection.php).  This Collection object is **iterable** and can be treated like an **array** which allows you to do things such as:

```
{{ dump(collection[page.path]) }}
```

Standard methods Iterable methods include:

* `Collection::append($items)` - Add another collection or array
* `Collection::first()` - Get the first item in the collection
* `Collection::last()` - Get the last item in the collection
* `Collection::random($num)` - Pick `$num` random items from the collection
* `Collection::reverse()` - Reverse the order of the collection
* `Collection::shuffle()` - Randomize the entire collection
* `Collection::slice($offset, $length)` - Slice the list

Also has several useful Collection-specific methods:

* `Collection::addPage($page)` - You can append another page to this collection.
* `Collection::copy()` - Creates a copy of the current collection
* `Collection::current()` - gets the current item in the collection
* `Collection::key()` - Returns the current slug of the the current item
* `Collection::remove($path)` - Removes a specific page in the collection, or current if `$path = null`
* `Collection::order($by, $dir, $manual)` - Orders the current collection
* `Collection::isFirst($path)` - Determines if the page identified by path is first
* `Collection::isLast($path)` - Determines if the page identified by path is last
* `Collection::prevSibling($path)` - Returns the previous sibling page if possible
* `Collection::nextSibling($path)` - Returns the next sibling page if possible
* `Collection::currentPosition($path)` - Returns the current index
* `Collection::dateRange($startDate, $endDate, $field)` - Filters the current collection with dates
* `Collection::visible()` - Filters the current collection to include only visible pages
* `Collection::nonVisible()` - Filters the current collection to include only non-visible pages
* `Collection::modular()`  - Filters the current collection to include only modular pages
* `Collection::nonModular()` - Filters the current collection to include only non-modular pages
* `Collection::published()` - Filters the current collection to include only published pages
* `Collection::nonPublished()` - Filters the current collection to include only non-published pages
* `Collection::routable()` - Filters the current collection to include only routable pages
* `Collection::nonRoutable()` - Filters the current collection to include only non-routabe pages
* `Collection::ofType($type)` - Filters the current collection to include only pages where template = `$type`.
* `Collection::ofOneOfTheseTypes($types)` - Filters the current collection to include only pages where template is in the array `$types`.
* `Collection::ofOneOfTheseAccessLevels($levels)` - Filters the current collection to include only pages where page access is in the array of `$levels`

## Programmatic Collections

You can take full control of collections directly from PHP in Grav plugins, themes, or even from Twig.  This is a more hard-coded approach compared to defining them in your page frontmatter, but it also allows for more complex and flexible collections logic.

### PHP Collections

You can perform advanced collection logic with PHP, for example:

```
$collection = new Collection();
$collection->setParams(['taxonomies' => ['tag' => ['dog', 'cat']]])->dateRange('01/01/2016', '12/31/2016')->published()->ofType('blog-item')->order('date', 'desc');

$titles = [];

foreach ($collection as $page) {
    $titles[] = $page->title();
}
```

You can also use the same `evaluate()` method that the frontmatter-based page collections make use of:

```
$page = Grav::instance()['page'];
$collection = $page->evaluate(['@page.children' => '/blog', '@taxonomy.tag' => 'photography']);
```

You can also do similar directly in Twig:

```
{% set collection = page.evaluate([{'@page.children':'/blog', '@taxonomy.tag':'photography'}]) %}
```
