The **Content Editor** is a powerful view in **Flex Objects** that enables you to create and update your content type.

Editor may look very different with different **Controls**, **Tabs** and **Form Fields** as they are all specific for the directory type you're editing.

### Controls

Along the top of the page, you will find the administrative controls.

By default, there are three buttons **Back**, **Save** and **Delete**. Controls may also include other actions, such as **Preview**, **Export** etc...

- **Back**: Go back to **[Content Listing](/advanced/flex/administration/views-list)**
- **Save**: Save Object and return back to **[Content Listing](/advanced/flex/administration/views-list)**
- **Delete**: Delete Object and return back to **[Content Listing](/advanced/flex/administration/views-list)**

### Edit Form

Form is usually organized by **Tabs** and **Sections** to make the content easier to edit.

- [Form fields](/forms/blueprints/fields-available)
- Media (images and other files)
