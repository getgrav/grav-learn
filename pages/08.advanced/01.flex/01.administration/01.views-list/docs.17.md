The **Content Listing** usually contains a paginated list to your content, but some directories, like **[Pages](/admin-panel/page)**, may have highly customized look.

This is where you can create, edit and delete your content. The page also has powerful tools to **Search** and **Order** the items.

## Controls

Along the top of the page, you will find the administrative controls. The controls may differ per **Flex Type**, but here is a list of some of the most common ones:

- **Back**: Return one level up, usually to [**Dashboard**](/admin-panel/dashboard) or **[Directory Listing](/advanced/flex/administration#directory-listing)**
- **Export**: Export content to a file, usually CVS
- **Add**: Add a new content item
- [**Configuration**](/advanced/flex/administration/configuration): Modify directory settings

## Navigation

- **Filter**: Text input for searching
- **Display Number**: Number of objects to dispay
- **Ordering**: Click on the column titles to change ordering
- **Pagination**: Quickly navigate through objects

## Single Row

- **Columns**: Type specific columns for quick overview on objects
- **Actions**: Actions for the single object, usually: **Preview**, **Edit**, **Delete**...
