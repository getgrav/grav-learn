!! Grav has preliminary multisite support available.  However, CLI commands as well as the Admin plugin still need to be updated to fully support multisite configurations.  We will continue to work on this in subsequent releases of Grav.

### What is a Multisite Setup?

> A multisite setup allows you to create and manage a network of multiple websites, all running on a single installation.

Grav has built-in multisite support. This functionality extends the [basic environment configuration](../environment-config), which lets you define custom environments for your production and development sites.

A full multisite setup gives you the power to change the way how and from where Grav loads all its files.

### Requirements for a Grav Multisite Setup

The most important thing you will need to run a Grav multisite network is good website hosting. If you are not planning to create many sites and do not expect many visitors, then you can get away with shared hosting. However, due to the nature of multisites, you’d probably need a VPS or dedicated server as your sites grow.

### Setup and installation

Before you begin, you’ll want to be sure your web server is capable of running multiple websites i.e., you have access to your Grav root directory.

This is essential since serving multiple websites from the same installation is based on a `setup.php` file located in your Grav root.

#### Quickstart (for Beginners)

Once created, the `setup.php` is called every time a user requests a page. In order to serve multiple websites from one single installation, this script (roughly speaking) has to tell Grav where the files (for the configurations, themes, plugins, pages etc.) for a specific subsite are located.

The provided snippets below setup your Grav installation in such a way that a request like

[prism classes="language-text"]
http://<subsite>.example.com   -->   user/sites/<subsite>.example.com
[/prism]
or
[prism classes="language-text"]
http://example.com/<subsite>   -->   user/sites/<subsite>
[/prism]

will use the `user/sites` directory as the base "user" path instead of the `user` directory.

If you choose sub-directories or path based URLs for subsites, then the only thing you need is to create a directory for each subsite in the `user/sites` directory containing at least the required folders `config`, `pages`, `plugins`, and `themes`.

If you choose sub-domains for structuring your website network, then you will have to configure (wildcard) sub-domains on your server in addition to the setup of your subsites in your `user/sites` directory.

Either way, decide which setup suits you best.

##### Snippets

For subsites accessible via sub-domains copy the `setup_subdomain.php` file, otherwise for subsites accessible via sub-directories the `setup_subdirectory.php` file into your `setup.php`.

!!! The `setup.php` file must be put in the Grav root folder, the same folder where you can find `index.php`, `README.md` and the other Grav files.

**setup_subdomain.php**:
[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
<?php
/**
 * Multisite setup for subsites accessible via sub-domains.
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
 */

use Grav\Common\Utils;

// Get subsite name from sub-domain
$environment = isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])
    ? $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
    : (isset($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']) ? $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] : 'localhost');
// Remove port from HTTP_HOST generated $environment
$environment = strtolower(Utils::substrToString($environment, ':'));
$folder = "sites/{$environment}";

if ($environment === 'localhost' || !is_dir(ROOT_DIR . "user/{$folder}")) {
    return [];
}

return [
    'environment' => $environment,
    'streams' => [
        'schemes' => [
            'user' => [
               'type' => 'ReadOnlyStream',
               'prefixes' => [
                   '' => ["user/{$folder}"],
               ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
[/prism]

**setup_subdirectory.php**:
[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
<?php
/**
 * Multisite setup for sub-directories or path based
 * URLs for subsites.
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
 */

use Grav\Common\Filesystem\Folder;

// Get relative path from Grav root.
$path = isset($_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])
   ? $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']
   : Folder::getRelativePath($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], ROOT_DIR);

// Extract name of subsite from path
$name = Folder::shift($path);
$folder = "sites/{$name}";
$prefix = "/{$name}";

if (!$name || !is_dir(ROOT_DIR . "user/{$folder}")) {
    return [];
}

// Prefix all pages with the name of the subsite
$container['pages']->base($prefix);

return [
    'environment' => $name,
    'streams' => [
        'schemes' => [
            'user' => [
               'type' => 'ReadOnlyStream',
               'prefixes' => [
                   '' => ["user/{$folder}"],
               ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
[/prism]

When using subdirectories to switch language contexts you might need to load different configs depending on the language.
You can place your language specific configs in `config/<lang-context>/site.yaml` using the example for `setup_subdir_config_switch.php` below.
This way `yoursite.com/de-AT/index.html` would load `config/de-AT/site.yaml`, `yoursite.com/de-CH/index.html` would load `config/de-CH/site.yaml` and so on.

**setup_subdir_config_switch.php**:
[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
<?php
/**
 * Switch config based on the language context subdir
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
 */

use Grav\Common\Filesystem\Folder;

$languageContexts = [
    'de-AT',
    'de-CH',
    'de-DE',
];

// Get relative path from Grav root.
$path = isset($_SERVER['PATH_INFO'])
    ? $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']
    : Folder::getRelativePath($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], ROOT_DIR);

// Extract name of subdir from path
$name = Folder::shift($path);

if (in_array($name, $languageContexts)) {
    return [
        'streams' => [
            'schemes' => [
                'config' => [
                    'type' => 'ReadOnlyStream',
                    'prefixes' => [
                        '' => [
                            'environment://config',
                            'user://config/' . $name,
                            'user://config',
                            'system/config',
                        ],
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ];
}

return [];
[/prism]

#### Advanced configuration (for Experts)

Once created a `setup.php` have access to two important variables: (i) `$container`, which is the yet not properly initialized [Grav instance](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/blob/develop/system/src/Grav/Common/Grav.php) and (ii) `$self`, which is an instance of the [ConfigServiceProvider class](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/blob/develop/system/src/Grav/Common/Service/ConfigServiceProvider.php).

Inside this script, you can do anything, but please be aware that the `setup.php` is called every time a user requests a page. This means that memory critical or time-consuming initializations operations lead to a slow-down of your whole system and should therefore be avoided.

In the end, the `setup.php` has to return an associative array with the optional environment name **environment** and a stream collection **streams**
(for more informations and in order to set them up correctly, see the section [Streams](#streams)):

[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
return [
  'environment' => '<name>',            // A name for the environment
  'streams' => [
    'schemes' => [
      '<stream_name>' => [              // The name of the stream
        'type' => 'ReadOnlyStream',     // Stream object e.g. 'ReadOnlyStream' or 'Stream'
        'prefixes' => [
          '<prefix>' => [
            '<path1>',
            '<path2>',
            '<etc>'
          ]
        ],
        'paths' => [                    // Paths (optional)
          '<paths1>',
          '<paths2>',
          '<etc>'
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

[/prism]

!!!! Please be aware that a this very early stage you neither have access to the configuration nor to the URI instance and thus any call to a non-initialized class might end in a freeze of the system, in unexpected errors or in (complete) data loss.

#### Streams

In Grav streams are objects, mapping a set of physical directories of the system to a logical device. They are classified via their `type` attribute. For read-only streams that's the `ReadOnlyStream` type and for read-writeable streams that's the `Stream` type. You can register any custom stream type and pointing to it as long as it is an instance of the [StreamInterface](https://github.com/rockettheme/toolbox/blob/develop/StreamWrapper/src/StreamInterface.php) interface class.

By default, streams have been configured like this:

* `user://` - user folder. e.g. `user/`
* `page://` - pages folder. e.g. `user://pages/`
* `image://` - images folder. e.g. `user://images/`, `system://images/`
* `account://` - accounts folder. e.g. `user://accounts/`
* `environment://` - current multi-site location.
* `asset://` - compiled JS/CSS folder. e.g. `assets/`
* `blueprints://` - blueprints folder. e.g. `environment://blueprints/`, `user://blueprints/`, `system://blueprints/`
* `config://` - configuration folder. e.g. `environment://config/`, `user://config/`, `system://config/`
* `plugins://` - plugins folder.  e.g. `user://plugins/`
* `themes://` - current theme.  e.g. `user://themes/`
* `theme://` - current theme.  e.g. `themes://antimatter/`
* `languages://` - languages folder. e.g. `environment://languages/`, `user://languages/`, `system://languages/`
* `user-data://` - data folder.  e.g. `user/data/`
* `system://` - system folder. e.g. `system/`
* `cache://` - cache folder. e.g. `cache/`, `images/`
* `log://` - log folder. e.g. `logs/`
* `backup://` - backup folder. e.g. `backups/`
* `tmp://` - temporary folder. e.g. `tmp/`

Mapping physical directories to a logical device can be done in two ways, either by setting up `paths` or `prefixes`. The former can be understood as a 1-to-1 mapping, whereas the latter (as the name suggests) allows you to combine several physical paths into one logical stream. Let's say you want to register a stream with the name "image". You can then with the stream `images://` list with

[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
'image' => [
    'type' => 'ReadOnlyStream',
    'paths' => [
        'user/images',
        'system/images'
    ]
];
[/prism]

all images located in the folders `user/images` and `system/images`. For **prefixes** consider the example

[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
'cache' => [
    'type' => 'Stream',
    'prefixes' => [
        '' => ['cache'],
        'images' => ['images']
    ]
];
[/prism]

In this case `cache://` resolves to `cache`, but `cache://images` resolves to `images`.

Last but not least, streams can be used in other streams. For example, provided a stream `user` and a stream `system` exists, the above "image" stream can also be written as

[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
'image' => [
    'type' => 'ReadOnlyStream',
    'paths' => [
        'user://images',
        'system://images'
    ]
];

[/prism]

### Server Based Multi-Site Configuration

Grav 1.7 adds support to customize initial environment from your server configuration.

This feature comes handy if you want to use for example docker containers and you want to make them independent of the domain you happen to use. Or if do not want to store secrets in the configuration, but to store them in your server setup.

The following environment variables can be used to customize the default paths which Grav uses to setup the environment. After initialization the streams may point to different location.

!!! **Note:** You can use either environment variables or PHP constants, but they need to be set before Grav runs.

[div class="table-keycol"]
| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **GRAV_SETUP_PATH** | AUTO DETECT | A custom path to `setup.php` file including the filename. By default Grav looks the file from `GRAV_ROOT/setup.php` and `GRAV_ROOT/GRAV_USER_PATH/setup.php`. |
| **GRAV_USER_PATH** | `user` | A relative path for `user://` stream. |
| **GRAV_CACHE_PATH** | `cache` | A relative path for `cache://` stream. |
| **GRAV_LOG_PATH** | `logs` | A relative path for `log://` stream. |
| **GRAV_TMP_PATH** | `tmp` | A relative path for `tmp://` stream. |
| **GRAV_BACKUP_PATH** | `backup` | A relative path for `backup://` stream. |
[/div]

In addition there are variables to customize the environments. Better documentation for these can be found in [Server Based Environment Configuration](/advanced/environment-config#server-based-environment-configuration).

!!! **Note:** These work also from `setup.php` file. You can either make them constants by using `define()` or environment variables with `putenv()`. Constants are preferred over environment variables.

[div class="table-keycol"]
| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **GRAV_ENVIRONMENT** | DOMAIN NAME | Environment name. Can be used for example in docker containers to set a custom environment which does not rely domain name, such as `production` and `develop`. |
| **GRAV_ENVIRONMENTS_PATH** | `user://env` | Lookup path for all environments if you do prefer something like `user://sites`. Can be either a stream or relative path from `GRAV_ROOT`. |
| **GRAV_ENVIRONMENT_PATH** | `user://env/ENVIRONMENT` | Sometimes it may be useful to have a custom location for your environment. |
[/div]

#### Server Based Configuration Overrides

If you do not wish to store secret credentials inside the configuration, you can also provide them by using environment variables from your server.

As environmental variables have strict naming requirements (they can only contain A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and _), some tricks are needed to get the configuration overrides to work.

Here is an example of a simple configuration override using YAML format for presentation:

```yaml
GRAV_CONFIG: true                           # If false, the configuration here will be ignored.

GRAV_CONFIG_ALIAS__GITHUB: plugins.github   # Create alias GITHUB='plugins.github' to shorten the variable names below

GRAV_CONFIG__GITHUB__auth__method: api      # Override config.plugins.github.auth.method = api
GRAV_CONFIG__GITHUB__auth__token: xxxxxxxx  # Override config.plugins.github.auth.token = xxxxxxxx
```

In above example `__` (double underscore) represents nested variable, which in twig is represented with `.` (dot).

You can also use environment variables in `setup.php`. This allows you for example to store secrets outside the configuration:

`user/setup.php`:
```php
<?php

// Use following environment variables in your server configuration:
//
// DYNAMODB_SESSION_KEY: DynamoDb server key for the PHP session storage
// DYNAMODB_SESSION_SECRET: DynamoDb server secret
// DYNAMODB_SESSION_REGION: DynamoDb server region
// GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY: Google Maps secret key

return [
    'plugins' => [
        // This plugin does not exist
        'dynamodb_session' => [
            'credentials' => [
                'key' => getenv('DYNAMODB_SESSION_KEY') ?: null,
                'secret' => getenv('DYNAMODB_SESSION_SECRET') ?: null
            ],
            'region' => getenv('DYNAMODB_SESSION_REGION') ?: null
        ],
        // This plugin does not exist
        'google_maps' => [
            'key' => getenv('GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY') ?: null
        ]
    ]
];
```

!! **WARNING:** `setup.php` is used to set initial configuration. If the plugin or your configuration later override these settings, the initial values get lost.

After defining the variables in `setup.php`, you can then set those in your server:
