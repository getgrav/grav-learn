---

Grav 1.7 introduces a few new features, improvements, bug fixes and provides many architectural changes which pave the road towards Grav 2.0. Here are a few highlights:

* **Flex Objects**: A new way to build your own data types.
* **Symfony Server**: Run Grav without needing to install web server.
* **Improved Multi-Language**: Better language fallbacks, improved admin support.
* **Improved Multi-Site**: Admin has improved multi-site support.
* **Improved Admin ACL**: Full CRUD support for users and pages.
* **Improved Media Support**: Support `webp` image format, lazy loading and more.
* **Improved Caching**: New `{% cache %}` tag and improved performance especially in admin.
* **Better Debugging Tools**: [Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork/) integration, Twig profiling and support for [Tideways XHProf](https://github.com/tideways/php-xhprof-extension) PHP Extension for performance profiling.

!!!! **IMPORTANT:** For most people, Grav 1.7 should be a simple upgrade without any issues, but like any upgrade, it is recommended to **take a backup** of your site and **test the upgrade in a testing environment** before upgrading your live site.

### YAML

! **NOTE:** Grav 1.7 YAML parser is more strict and your site may break if you have syntax errors in your configuration files or page headers.

!!! **TIP:** **Grav 1.6 Upgrade Guide** has a dedicated **[YAML Parsing](/advanced/grav-development/grav-16-upgrade-guide#yaml-parsing)** section to help you to fix these issues.

By default, Grav 1.7 uses a **Symfony 4.4 YAML parser**, which follows the [YAML standard specification](https://yaml.org/spec?target=_blank) more closely than the older versions of Grav. This means that YAML files which previously worked just fine, may cause errors resulting from being invalid YAML. However, Grav will by default still fall back to the older 3.4 version of the parser to keep your site up and running.

!!! **TIP:** You should run **CLI command** `bin/grav yamllinter` or visit in **Admin** > **Tools** > **Reports** before and after upgrade and fix all the YAML related warnings and errors.

### Twig

!!! **TIP:** **Grav 1.6 Upgrade Guide** has a dedicated **[Twig](/advanced/grav-development/grav-16-upgrade-guide#twig)** section. It is very important to read it first!

Twig template engine has been updated to version 1.43, but it also supports Twig 2.13. In order to support this newer version of Twig, you need to update any old syntax in your Twig templates. **Grav 1.6 Upgrade Guide** helps you to do this.

Additional changes in templating are:

* Added a new `{% cache %}` Twig tag eliminating need for `twigcache` extension.
* Added `array_diff()` twig function
* Added `template_from_string()` twig function
* Added a new `svg_image()` twig function to make it easier to 'include' SVG source in Twig
* Improved `url()` twig function to take third parameter (`true`) to return URL on non-existing file instead of returning false
* Improved `|array` twig filter to work with iterators and objects with `toArray()` method
* Improved `authorize()` twig function to work better with nested rule parameters
* Improved `|yaml_serialize` twig filter: added support for `JsonSerializable` objects and other array-like objects
* Added default templates for `external.html.twig`, `default.html.twig`, and `modular.html.twig`

## Forms

In forms declaring `validation: strict` was not as strict as we hoped because of a bug. The strict mode should prevent forms from sending any extra fields and this was fixed into Grav 1.7. Unfortunately many of the old forms declared to be strict even if they had extra data in them.

Because of this, we added new configuration option `system.strict_mode.blueprint_compat: true` to maintain old `validation: strict` behavior. It is recommended to turn off this setting to improve site security, but before doing that, please search through all your forms if you were using `validation: strict` feature. If you were, either remove the line or test if the form still works.

! **NOTE:** This backwards compatibility fallback mechanism will be removed in Grav 2.0

### User Accounts

Admin has now new [Accounts Administration](/admin-panel/accounts) using **Flex Users**:

* [User Accounts Manager](/admin-panel/accounts/users)
* [User Groups Manager](/admin-panel/accounts/groups)

!!! **NOTE:** Flex Users feature is not yet used in the frontend of your site.

### Pages

The existing [Pages Administration](/admin-panel/page) has been greatly improved with **Flex Pages**:

* Reworked list view: Far better support for large sites
* Better access control: [CRUD ACL](/admin-panel/page/permissions) support with page owners
* Better multi-language support

!! **BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY BREAK**: We fixed 404 error page when you go to non-routable page with routable child pages under it. Now you get redirected to the first routable child page instead. This is probably what you wanted in the first place.

!!! **NOTE:** Flex Pages feature is not yet used in the frontend of your site.

### Multi-language

Grav 1.7 changed the behavior of how the multi-language fallbacks work for the pages.

Previously if the page did not exist with the requested language, the old implementation looked up the next supported language. This meant that the untranslated page was always displayed, but the page could be using some unknown language to the reader.

The new behavior is to fall back only to the default language of the site. This default behavior can be overridden by setting fallback languages per language by using `system.languages.content_fallback` configuration option.

If the page does not exist in any of the fallback languages, **404 Not Found** will be displayed instead.

!! **BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY BREAK**: Please add correct fallback languages for the page content in `system.yaml` or admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Languages** > **Content Language Fallback**.

### Media

Media handling has been greatly improved in Grav 1.7. Some highlights are:

* Support for `webp` image format
* Markdown: Added support for native `loading=lazy` attributes on images.  Can be set in `system.images.defaults` or per md image with `?loading=lazy`
* Added ability to `noprocess` specific items only in Link/Image Excerpts, e.g. `http://foo.com/page?id=foo&target=_blank&noprocess=id`

### CLI

Some highlights are:

* Added new `bin/grav server` CLI command to easily run Symfony or PHP built-in web servers
* Improved `Scheduler` cron command check and more useful CLI information
* Added new `-r <job-id>` option for Scheduler CLI command to force-run a job
* Improved `bin/grav yamllinter` CLI command by adding an option to find YAML Linting issues from the whole site or custom folder

### Configuration

Added new configuration option to keep default language in `.md` files if set to `false`
  * system.yaml: `languages.include_default_lang_file_extension`: **true**|false
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Languages** > **Include default language in file extension**

Added new configuration option to set fallback content languages individually for every language
  * system.yaml: `languages.content_fallback`: See [Language Configuration](/content/multi-language#language-configuration)
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Languages** > **Content Language Fallback**

Added new configuration option to choose between debugbar and clockwork
  * system.yaml: `debugger.provider`: **clockwork**|debugbar
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Debugger** > **Debugger Provider**

Added new configuration option to hide potentially sensitive information
  * system.yaml: `debugger.censored`: **false**|true
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Debugger** > **Censor Sensitive Data**

Added new configuration option to maintain old `validation: strict` behavior
  * system.yaml: `strict_mode.blueprint_compat`: **true**|false
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Advanced** > **Blueprint Compatibility**

Added system configuration support for `HTTP_X_FORWARDED` headers (host disabled by default)
  * system.yaml: `http_x_forwarded.protocol`: **true**|false
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Advanced** > **HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO Enabled**
  * system.yaml: `http_x_forwarded.host`: true|**false**
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Advanced** > **HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST Enabled**
  * system.yaml: `http_x_forwarded.port`: **true**|false
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Advanced** > **HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT Enabled**
  * system.yaml: `http_x_forwarded.ip`: true|**false**
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Advanced** > **HTTP_X_FORWARDED IP Enabled**

Added new configuration option to enable Flex Pages in the frontend
  * **EXPERIMENTAL**: Use only for testing purposes!
  * system.yaml: `pages.type`: **regular**|flex
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **System** > **Experimental** > **Frontend Page Type**

Added new configuration option `security.sanitize_svg` to remove potentially dangerous code from SVG files
  * security.yaml: `sanitize_svg`: **true**|false
  * Admin: **Configuration** > **Security** > **Sanitize SVG**

## DEVELOPERS

### Debugging

* Added support for [Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork) developer tools (now default debugger)
* Added support for [Tideways XHProf](https://github.com/tideways/php-xhprof-extension) PHP Extension for profiling method calls
* Added Twig profiling for Clockwork debugger

### Use composer autoloader

* Please add `composer.json` file to your plugin and run `composer update --no-dev` (and remember to keep it updated):

    composer.json
    ```json
    {
        "name": "getgrav/grav-plugin-example",
        "type": "grav-plugin",
        "description": "Example plugin for Grav CMS",
        "keywords": ["example", "plugin"],
        "homepage": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-example",
        "license": "MIT",
        "authors": [
            {
                "name": "...",
                "email": "...",
                "homepage": "...",
                "role": "Developer"
            }
        ],
        "support": {
            "issues": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-example/issues",
            "docs": "https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-example/blob/master/README.md"
        },
        "require": {
            "php": ">=7.1.3"
        },
        "autoload": {
            "psr-4": {
                "Grav\\Plugin\\Example\\": "classes/",
                "Grav\\Plugin\\Console\\": "cli/"
            },
            "classmap":  [
                "example.php"
            ]
        },
        "config": {
            "platform": {
                "php": "7.1.3"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

  See [Composer schema](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md)

* Please use autoloader instead of `require` in the code:

    example.php
    ```php
      /**
       * @return array
       */
      public static function getSubscribedEvents(): array
      {
          return [
              'onPluginsInitialized' => [
                  // This is only required in Grav 1.6. Grav 1.7 automatically calls $plugin->autolaod() method.
                  ['autoload', 100000],
              ]
          ];
      }

      /**
       * Composer autoload.
       *
       * @return \Composer\Autoload\ClassLoader
       */
      public function autoload(): \Composer\Autoload\ClassLoader
      {
          return require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
      }
    ```

* Plugins & Themes: Call `$plugin->autoload()` and `$theme->autoload()` automatically when object gets initialized
* Make sure your code does not use `require` or `include` for loading classes

### Plugin/Theme Blueprints (`blueprints.yaml`)

* Please add:
    ```yaml
    slug: folder-name
    type: plugin|theme
    ```
* Make sure you update your dependencies. I recommend setting Grav to either 1.6 or 1.7 and update your code/vendor to PHP 7.1
    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        - { name: grav, version: '>=1.6.0' }
    ```

* Added `themes` to cached blueprints and configuration

### Sessions

* Session ID now changes on login to prevent session fixation issues
* Added `Session::regenerateId()` method to properly prevent session fixation issues

### ACL

* `user.authorize()` now requires user to be authorized (passed 2FA check), unless the rule contains `login` in its name.
* Added support for more advanced ACL (CRUD)

* **BC BREAK** `user.authorize()` and Flex `object.isAuthorized()` now have two deny states: `false` and `null`.

    Make sure you do not have strict checks against false: `$user->authorize($action) === false` (PHP)  or `user.authorize(action) is same as(false)` (Twig).

    For the negative checks you should be using `!user->authorize($action)` (PHP) or `not user.authorize(action)` (Twig).

    The change has been done to allow strong deny rules by chaining the actions if previous ones do not match: `user.authorize(action1) ?? user.authorize(action2) ?? user.authorize(action3)`.

    Note that Twig function `authorize()` will still **keeps** the old behavior!

### Pages

* Added experimental support for `Flex Pages` in the frontend (not recommended to use yet)
* Admin uses `Flex Pages` by default (can be disabled from `Flex-Objects` plugin)
* Added page specific admin permissions support for `Flex Pages`
* Added root page support for `Flex Pages`
* Fixed wrong `Pages::dispatch()` calls (with redirect) when we really meant to call `Pages::find()`
* Added `Pages::getCollection()` method
* Moved `collection()` and `evaluate()` logic from `Page` class into `Pages` class
* **DEPRECATED** `$page->modular()` in favor of `$page->isModule()`
* **DEPRECATED** `PageCollectionInterface::nonModular()` in favor of `PageCollectionInterface::pages()`
* **DEPRECATED** `PageCollectionInterface::modular()` in favor of `PageCollectionInterface::modules()`

* **BC BREAK** Fixed `Page::modular()` and `Page::modularTwig()` returning `null` for folders and other non-initialized pages. Should not affect your code unless you were checking against `false` or `null`.
* **BC BREAK** Always use `\Grav\Common\Page\Interfaces\PageInterface` instead of `\Grav\Common\Page\Page` in method signatures
* Admin now uses `Flex Pages` by default, collection will behave in slightly different way
* **BC BREAK** `$page->topParent()` may return page itself instead of null

### Media

* Added `MediaTrait::freeMedia()` method to free media (and memory)
* Added support for uploading and deleting images directly in `Media` by using PSR-7
* Adjusted asset types to enable extension of assets in class
* **BC BREAK** Media no longer extends `Getters`, accessing `$media->$filename` no longer works, use `$media[$filename]` instead!

### Markdown

* **BC BREAK** Upgraded Parsedown to 1.7 for Parsedown-Extra 0.8. Plugins that extend Parsedown may need a fix to render as HTML
* Added new `Excerpts::processLinkHtml()` method

### Users

* Added experimental support for `Flex Users` in the frontend (not recommended to use yet)
* Admin uses `Flex Users` by default (can be disabled from `Flex-Objects` plugin)
* Improved `Flex Users`: obey blueprints and allow Flex to be used in admin only
* Improved `Flex Users`: user and group ACL now supports deny permissions
* Changed `UserInterface::authorize()` to return `null` having the same meaning as `false` if access is denied because of no matching rule
* **DEPRECATED** `\Grav\Common\User\Group` in favor of `$grav['user_groups']`, which contains Flex UserGroup collection
* **BC BREAK** Always use `\Grav\Common\User\Interfaces\UserInterface` instead of `\Grav\Common\User\User` in method signatures

### Flex

* Do not use `Framework` Flex classes directly, it's better to use or extend classes under `Grav\Common\Flex\Types\Generic` namespace
* Added `$grav['flex']` to access all registered Flex Directories
  * Added `FlexRegisterEvent` which triggers when `$grav['flex']` is being accessed the first time
* Added `hasFlexFeature()` method to test if `FlexObject` or `FlexCollection` implements a given feature
* Added `getFlexFeatures()` method to return all features that `FlexObject` or `FlexCollection` implements
* Added `FlexStorage::getMetaData()` to get updated object meta information for listed keys
* `FlexDirectory::getObject()` can now be called without any parameters to create a new object
* Flex Directory: Implemented customizable configuration per flex type
* **DEPRECATED** `FlexDirectory::update()` and `FlexDirectory::remove()`
* **BC BREAK** Moved all Flex type classes under `Grav\Common\Flex`
* **BC BREAK** `FlexStorageInterface::getStoragePath()` and `getMediaPath()` can now return null
* **BC BREAK** Flex objects no longer return temporary key if they do not have one; empty key is returned instead
* **BC BREAK** Added reload argument to `FlexStorageInterface::getMetaData()`
* You can add `edit_list.html.twig` file to a form field in order to customize look in the listing view

### Multi-language

* Improved language support for `Route` class
* Translations: rename MODULAR to MODULE everywhere
* Added `Language::getPageExtensions()` to get full list of supported page language extensions
* **BC BREAK** Fixed `Language::getFallbackPageExtensions()` to fall back only to default language instead of going through all languages

### Blueprints

* Added `flatten_array` filter to form field validation
* Added support for `security@: or: [admin.super, admin.pages]` in blueprints (nested AND/OR mode support)
* Blueprint validation: Added `validate: value_type: bool|int|float|string|trim` to `array` to filter all the values inside the array
* If your plugins has blueprints folder, initializing it in the event will be too late. Do this instead:

    ```php
    class MyPlugin extends Plugin
    {
        /** @var array */
        public $features = [
            'blueprints' => 0, // Use priority 0
        ];
    }
    ```

### Events

* Use `Symfony EventDispatcher` directly instead of `rockettheme/toolbox` wrapper.
* Added `$grav->dispatchEvent()` method for PSR-14 events
* Added `PluginsLoadedEvent` which triggers after plugins have been loaded but not yet initialized
* Added `SessionStartEvent` which triggers when session is started
* Added `FlexRegisterEvent` which triggers when `$grav['flex']` is being accessed the first time
* Added `PermissionsRegisterEvent` which triggers when `$grav['permissions']` is being accessed the first time
* Added `onAfterCacheClear` event
* Check `onAdminTwigTemplatePaths` event, it should NOT be:

    ```php
    public function onAdminTwigTemplatePaths($event)
    {
        // This code breaks all the other plugins in admin, including Flex Objects
        $event['paths'] = [__DIR__ . '/admin/themes/grav/templates'];
    }
    ```
    but:
    ```php
    public function onAdminTwigTemplatePaths($event)
    {
        // Add plugin template path for admin.
        $paths = $event['paths'];
        $paths[] = __DIR__ . '/admin/themes/grav/templates';
        $event['paths'] = $paths;
    }
    ```

### Misc

* Added `Utils::isAssoc()` and `Utils::isNegative()` helper methods
* Added `Utils::simpleTemplate()` method for very simple variable templating
* Added `Utils::fullPath()` to get the full path to a file be it stream, relative, etc.
* Support customizable null character replacement in `CSVFormatter::decode()`
* Added new `Security::sanitizeSVG()` function
* Added `$grav->close()` method to properly terminate the request with a response
* Added `Folder::countChildren()` method to determine if a folder has child folders
* Support symlinks when saving `File`
* Added `Route::getBase()` method
* **BC BREAK** Make `Route` objects immutable. This means that you need to do: `{% set route = route.withExtension('.html') %}` (for all `withX` methods) to keep the updated version.
* Better `Content-Encoding` handling in Apache when content compression is disabled
* Added a `Uri::getAllHeaders()` compatibility function

### CLI

* **BC BREAK** Many plugins initialize Grav in a wrong way, it is not safe to initialize plugins and theme by yourself
    * Following calls require Grav 1.6.21 or later, so it is recommended to set Grav dependency to that version
    * Inside `serve()` method:
    * Call `$this->setLanguage($langCode);` before doing anything else if you want to set the language (or use default)
    * Call one of following:
        * `$this->initializeGrav();` Already called if you're in `bin/plugin`, otherwise you may need to call this one
        * `$this->initializePlugins();` This initializes grav, plugins (up to `onPluginsInitialized`)
        * `$this->initializeThemes();` This initializes grav, plugins and theme
        * `$this->initializePages();` This initializes grav, plugins, theme and everything needed by pages
* It is a good idea to prefix your CLI command classes with your plugin name, otherwise there may be naming conflicts (we already have some!)

### Composer dependencies

* Updated Symfony Components to 4.4, please update any deprecated features in your code
* **BC BREAK** Please run `bin/grav yamllinter -f user://` to find any YAML parsing errors in your site (including your plugins and themes).

## PLUGINS

### Admin

* Added `Content Editor` option to user account blueprint

* **BC BREAK** Admin will not initialize frontend pages anymore, this has been done to greatly speed up Admin plugin.

    Please call `$grav['admin']->enablePages()` or `{% do admin.enablePages() %}` if you need to access frontend pages. This call can be safely made multiple times.

    If you're using `Flex Pages`, please use Flex Directory instead, it will make your code so much faster.

* Admin now uses Flex for editing `Accounts` and `Pages`. If your plugin hooks into either of those, please make sure they still work.

* Admin cache is enabled by default, make sure your plugin clears cache when needed. Please avoid clearing all cache!

### Shortcode Core

* **DEPRECATED** Every shortcode needs to have `init()` method, classes without it will stop working in the future.
