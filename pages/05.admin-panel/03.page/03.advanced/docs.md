![Admin Page Editor](page-advanced.png?width=2528&classes=shadow)

The **Page Editor** in the admin is a powerful text editor and page manager that enables you to create your page's content (including media files), its publishing and taxonomy options, settings, overrides, and theme-specific options.

It's essentially a one-stop-shop for managing a specific page.

In this page, we will go over the features and functionality found in the **Advanced** tab of the **Page Editor**.

[version=15,16]
!! Accessing the Pages functionality requires an `access.admin.super` or `access.admin.pages` permission, see [Profile](/admin-panel/dashboard/profile)
[/version]
[version=17]
!! Accessing the Pages functionality requires an `access.admin.super` or `access.admin.pages.list` permission, see [User Accounts](/admin-panel/accounts/users) and [User Groups](/admin-panel/accounts/groups)
[/version]

! You might notice the check boxes to the left of some of the options in this area of the admin. These boxes indicate that you would like to override the default values for this page. Leaving them unchecked reverts to blank or default states.

### Settings

The **Settings** area focuses on various critical options for your page. This is where you would go to change the name of the folder the page is stored in, its parent, and the template used when displaying the page.

### Overrides

Overrides are those options that give your page extra functionality, set its slug to something different than the default one based on the folder name, caching settings, navigation visibility, and make a page unreachable via a direct URL.

You can also use this area to turn on and off various processes for the page, such as Twig which enables you to inject Twig into your page content and have it render.
