![Grav Admin Configuration](configuration.png)

The **Configuration** page gives you access to your site's **System** and **Site** configuration settings. Additionally, you can view a breakdown of your server's properties in a number of areas including PHP, server environment, and other various components that determine how your site operates.

!! The Configuration requires an `access.admin.super` or `access.admin.configuration` access level.

The **System** tab enables you to customize the settings found in the `/user/config/system.yaml` file. These settings affect how many of the primary system-related features of Grav operate. The site's home page, caching settings, and more can be configured here.

These settings are separated into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Grav's operation.

Below is a breakdown of the different configuration sections that appear in the **System** tab.
