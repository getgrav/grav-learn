![Admin Configuration](configuration.png?width=2530&classes=shadow)

The **Configuration** page gives you access to your site's **System** and **Site** configuration settings. Additionally, you can view a breakdown of your server's properties in a number of areas including PHP, server environment, and other various components that determine how your site operates.

!! The Configuration requires an `access.admin.super` or `access.admin.configuration` access level.

The **System** tab enables you to customize the settings found in the `/user/config/system.yaml` file. These settings affect how many of the primary system-related features of Grav operate. The site's home page, caching settings, and more can be configured here.

These settings are separated into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of Grav's operation.

Below is a breakdown of the different configuration sections that appear in the **System** tab.

### Content

### Twig Templating

| **Autoescape Variables** | Autoescapes all variables. This will break your site most likely.                             |
[/div]

### Assets

![Admin Configuration](configuration-system-assets.png?width=1502&classes=shadow)

[/div]

### Debugger

![Admin Configuration](configuration-system-debugger.png?width=950&classes=shadow)

Like error handling, Grav's integrated debugging tools give you the ability to locate and troubleshoot issues. This is especially useful during development.

[div class="table table-striped table-keycol"]
| Option                        | Description                                                            |

[/div]

### Media

![Admin Configuration](configuration-system-media.png?width=1670&classes=shadow)

This section determines how Grav handles media content. Image quality and other media handling options are configured here.

[div class="table table-striped table-keycol"]
| Option                         | Description                                                                                               |

| **Enable Timestamps on Media** | Appends a timestamp based on last modified date to each media item.                                       |
[/div]

!! Caching images that have already been optimised (outside of Grav) could result in the output file being a much larger filesize than the original. This is due to a bug in the Gregwar image library and not directly related to Grav (see this [open issue](https://github.com/Gregwar/Image/issues/115) for more information). The alternative is to set "Cache All Images" to No

### Session

![Admin Configuration](configuration-system-session.png?width=1184&classes=shadow)
