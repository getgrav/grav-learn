## Form actions

We saw some example form actions in the simple form example above. Let's detail the actions you can use.

### Email

Sends an email with the specified options.

Example:

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - email:
        from: "{{ config.plugins.email.from }}"
        to: "{{ config.plugins.email.to }}"
        subject: "Contact by {{ form.value.name|e }}"
        body: "{% include 'forms/data.html.twig' %}"
[/prism]

Sends an email from the email address specified in the Email plugin configuration, sends it to that same email address (it's a contact form, we send it to ourselves).
Unless you want to use other values, you could freely omit from and to, as they are already configured by default to use these values.
The email has the set subject and body.
In this case, the body is generated by the `forms/data.html.twig` file, which is found in the active template (Antimatter and the other main themes have it, but it's not guaranteed that every theme includes it).

Antimatter sets it to

[prism classes="language-twig line-numbers"]
{% for field in form.fields %}
    <div><strong>{{ field.label }}</strong>: {{ string(form.value(field.name)|e) }}</div>
{% endfor %}
[/prism]

In short, it just loops the values and prints them in the email body.

!! Refer to the email plugin documentation for additional [important form email options](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-email#emails-sent-with-forms) including [multipart message bodies](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-email#multi-part-mime-messages) (good for anti-spam scores), `reply_to`, and [attachments](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-email#sending-attachments).

##### Dynamic email attribute

If you want for example to set the `email.from` field from a Form input, you can get its content and use it in this way:

`from: "{{ form.value.email|e }}"`

In this case, we get the field "email" from the form, and use it for the "from" attribute. This way the site owner will receive an email and will be able to directly reply to the email entered in the form.

### Redirect

Redirects the user to another page. The action is immediate, so if you use this, you probably need to put it at the bottom of the actions list.

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - redirect: '/forms/landing-page'
[/prism]

You may also set some or all of the `redirect` field from a form input or hidden form field. You can get its content and use it in this way:

`redirect: "/path to/location/{{ form.value.hiddenfield }}"`

In this case, we get the field "hiddenfield" from the form, and use it for the last portion of the redirect location. This can be useful when creating forms that, for example, redirect to a download upon completion.

### Message

Sets a message to be shown in the next page. Works if you set a `display` action too, which redirects the user to another page. Note, you can use Twig in the message if you like.

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - message: Thank you for your feedback!
    - display: thankyou
[/prism]

#### Validation Message

You can utilize the message action to trigger in the event of a failed validation. For example:

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
username:
   type: text
   label: Username
   validate:
     required: true
     message: My custom message when validation fails!
[/prism]

This will enable you to write a custom message that users will see in the event that validation fails.

### Display

After submitting the form the user can be redirected to another page. That page will be a subpage of the form, so for example, if your form lives in `/form`, you can redirect users to `/form/thankyou` with the following code:

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - display: thankyou
[/prism]

The Form plugin provides a `formdata` template that's suitable for the process destination page, as it outputs the result of the form submission. In the above example, you could create a `pages/form/thankyou/formdata.md` page.

If you're redirecting to a subpage, `display: thankyou` works perfectly. If you're redirecting to an absolute page path, like `site.com/thankyou`, prepend it with `/`, for example: `display: /thankyou`.

Antimatter and compatible themes provide the `formdata.html.twig` Twig template, that looks like this:

[prism classes="language-twig line-numbers"]
{% extends 'partials/base.html.twig' %}

{% block content %}

    {{ content|raw }}

    <div class="alert">{{ form.message|e }}</div>
    <p>Here is the summary of what you wrote to us:</p>

    {% include "forms/data.html.twig" %}

{% endblock %}
[/prism]

If the `thankyou/formdata.md` page is

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
---
title: Email sent
cache_enable: false
process:
    twig: true
---

## Email sent!
[/prism]

The output will be a page with the "Email sent!" title, followed by a confirmation message and the form data entered in the previous page.

You could use any page type you want, as a destination page. Just create your own and set the destination page type accordingly.

### Save

Saves the form data to a file. The file is saved to the `user/data` folder, in a subfolder named as the `form.name` parameter. The form **must** have a name for this action to succeed, and the subfolder must be created with appropriate permissions before data can be saved in it, as a new directory will not be created if one does not exist. For example:

!! The `fileprefix` and `body` can contain Twig markup.

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - save:
        fileprefix: feedback-
        dateformat: Ymd-His-u
        extension: txt
        body: "{% include 'forms/data.txt.twig' %}"
        operation: create
[/prism]

The body is taken from the theme's `templates/forms/data.html.twig` file, provided by Antimatter and updated themes.

! the `operation` can be either `create` (default) to create a new file per-form-submission or `add` to append to a single file.

! note that the `add` operation now requires a static filename: to be defined see the example below.

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - save:
        filename: feedback.txt
        body: "{% include 'forms/data.txt.twig' %}"
        operation: add
[/prism]

### Captcha

To also validate the captcha server-side, add the captcha process action.

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
    process:
        - captcha:
            recaptcha_secret: ENTER_YOUR_CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY
[/prism]

!! The `recaptcha_secret` is optional and will use the Form plugin's configuration values if you have provided them there.

### User IP Address

Display the user's IP address on the output. Put it above email / save processes in the 'form.md' to ensure it is used by the output processe(s).

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - ip:
        label: User IP Address
[/prism]

### Timestamp

Add a form submission timestamp to the output. Put it above email / save processes in the 'form.md' to ensure it is used by the output process(es).

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
process:
    - timestamp:
        label: Submission Timestamp
[/prism]

### Reset the form after submit

By default, the form is not cleared after the submit. So if you don't have a `display` action and the user is sent back to the form page, it's still filled with the data entered. If you want to avoid this, add a `reset` action:

[prism classes="language-yaml"]
process:
    - reset: true
[/prism]

## Custom Actions

You can "hook" into a form processing and perform any kind of operation. Perform custom processing, add data for an online web application, even save to a database.

To do this, in the form process field add your own processing action name, for example 'yourAction'.

Then, create a simple plugin.

In its main PHP file, register for the event `onFormProcessed`

[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
namespace Grav\Plugin;
use Grav\Common\Plugin;
use RocketTheme\Toolbox\Event\Event;

class EmailPlugin extends Plugin
{
    public static function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return [
            'onFormProcessed' => ['onFormProcessed', 0]
        ];
    }
}
[/prism]

Then provide a handler for the saveToDatabase action:

[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
    public function onFormProcessed(Event $event)
    {
        $form = $event['form'];
        $action = $event['action'];
        $params = $event['params'];

        switch ($action) {
            case 'yourAction':
                //do what you want
        }
    }
[/prism]

If your processing might go wrong and you want to stop the next form actions, which are executed in series, you can stop the processing by calling `stopPropagation` on the $event object:

[prism classes="language-php line-numbers"]
$event->stopPropagation();
return;
[/prism]

Sample code with form handling is available in the Form plugin, and in the Email plugin repositories.

#### An example of custom form handling

The Form plugin offers this ability of sending emails, saving files, setting status messages and it’s really handy.
Sometimes however you need total control. That’s for example what the Login plugin does.

It defines the `login.md` page frontmatter:

[prism classes="language-yaml line-numbers"]
title: Login
template: form

form:
    name: login

    fields:
        - name: username
          type: text
          placeholder: Username
          autofocus: true

        - name: password
          type: password
          placeholder: Password
[/prism]

The Forms plugin correctly generates and shows the form. Notice there’s no `process` defined.

The form `buttons` are missing too, since they’re manually added in `templates/login.html.twig`. That’s where the form `action` and `task` are defined too.

In this case, `task` is `login.login`, and `action` is set to the page url.

When a user presses 'Login' in the form, Grav calls the `onTask.login.login` event.

`user/plugins/login/login.php` hooks up to `onTask.login.login` to its `classes/controller.php` file, and that's where the authentication happens.
