You can create any type of Frontend Form using the Form Plugin.

The Form plugin for Grav is a Form Construction Kit available for you to use in your own pages.

Let's see how to create a simple form.

## Create a simple form

Every page in the site can host a form.

To add a form to a page, name the page file as `form.md`

The form is defined in the page YAML frontmatter.
At the moment there isn't an easy-to-use interface for the Forms plugin, although that is in the plans for the future.

Here's an example of a form:

```yaml
title: A page with a form
form:
    name: my-nice-form
    fields:
        - name: name
          label: Name
          placeholder: Enter your name
          autofocus: on
          autocomplete: on
          type: text
          validate:
            required: true

        - name: email
          label: Email
          placeholder: Enter your email address
          type: email
          validate:
            required: true

    buttons:
        - type: submit
          value: Submit
        - type: reset
          value: Reset
```

This is enough to show a form in the page, below the page content. Itâ€™s as simple form with a name and email field, with two buttons, one to submit the form and one to reset the fields.

What happens when you press the `Submit` button? Right now, nothing. You need to specify how the form will be processed. How? By adding a `process` field to the page yaml frontmatter:

```
process:
    - email:
        from: "{{ config.plugins.email.from }}"
        to:
          - "{{ config.plugins.email.from }}"
          - "{{ form.value.email }}"
        subject: "[Feedback] {{ form.value.name|e }}"
        body: "{% include 'forms/data.html.twig' %}"
    - save:
        fileprefix: feedback-
        dateformat: Ymd-His-u
        extension: txt
        body: "{% include 'forms/data.txt.twig' %}"
    - message: Thank you for your feedback!
    - display: thankyou
```

!!! Make sure you configured the "Email from" and "Email to" email addresses in the Email plugin with your email address

What does this do is simple: it executes the passed actions in serie.

1. An email is sent to the email entered, with the subject `[Feedback] [name entered]`. The body of the email is defined in the forms/data.html.twig file of the theme in use.

2. A file is created in `user/data` to store the form input data. The template is defined in forms/data.txt.twig of the theme in use.

3. The `thankyou` subpage is shown, along with the passed message. The `thankyou` page must be a subpage of the page containing the form.
