## Available Form Fields for Use in the Admin

Plugins and themes can take advantage of these built-in form fields in their **blueprints.yaml** file. These fields are all supported directly within Grav, and can be implemented very easily.

Here's a list of the available form fields:

### Common Form Fields

- **Captcha**: an anti-spam Captcha field, using reCAPTCHA
- **Checkbox**: a simple check box
- **Checkboxes**: a series of check boxes
- **Date**: a date selection field
- **Display**: a simple field for text or instructions (not an input field)
- **Email**: an email field, with validation
- **File**: a file upload field, with validation
- **Hidden**: a hidden field
- **Password**: a password field
- **Radio**: a radio input type
- **Select**: a select field
- **Spacer**: used to add a title, text or an horizontal line to the form
- **Text**: a simple text field
- **Textarea**: a text area

### Special Form Fields Available Exclusively in the Admin

- **Array**: a special field used for example in the **page metadata** allowing the user to add multiple key-value rows.
- **Ignore**: used to remove unused fields when extending from another blueprint
- **Columns**: used to break the form in multiple columns
