For the fastest way to get Grav up and running, you can run Grav using a simple command from Terminal / Command Prompt using the built-in PHP server available as long as you have PHP installed.

All you need to do is navigate to the root of your Grav install using the Terminal or Command Prompt and enter `bin/grav server`.

!! While technically all you need is PHP installed, if you install the [Symfony CLI application](https://symfony.com/download) the server will provide an SSL certificate so you can use `https://` and make use of PHP-FPM for better performance.

Entering this command will present you with output similar to the following:

Your terminal will also give you real-time updates of any activity on this ad hoc-style server. You can copy the URL provided in the `[OK] Web server listening` line and paste that into your browser of choice to access your site, including the administrator.

!!!! This is a useful tool for quick development, and should **not** be used in place of a dedicated web server such as Apache or Nginx.
