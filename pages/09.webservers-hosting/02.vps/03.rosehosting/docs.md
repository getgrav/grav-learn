Back in 2001, [RoseHosting](https://www.rosehosting.com) was the first and only company in the world to offer commercial Linux virtual servers.  Now they offer a wide range of Linux hosting packages, including **Linux VPS** powered by enterprise **SSD Storage**. All their hosting plans are **fully managed** and include **free 24/7 support**, so they can install and set up Grav for you for free.

Navigate to their [Linux VPS Hosting](https://www.rosehosting.com/linux-vps-hosting.html) page and **choose a VPS hosting plan** that suits you the most. You can even create a custom VPS based on your needs. For this guide, we'll be using the smallest plan, 'SSD 1 VPS'.

After you enter your existing domain name's information or order a new one, you'll be taken to the **Product Configuration** page where you can choose your billing cycle and the OS you want to use. For this guide we'll be using **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**. You can get an additional DNS service for free and order addons like WHM/cPanel and Softaculous. Their support team can install Webmin or any other application on your VPS for free. Confirm the order information and billing information and submit it.

Your order will be processed and confirmed, after which you will receive an e-mail with information about your VPS. You will get an SSH login and password with **full root access**.
